        <subheading>What is tasteful?</subheading>
        <paragraph>
          tasteful is a platform that allows you to rate, review, and catalog
          your music collection. Although the platform is comparable to the
          (fantastic!) websites
          <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com">Rate Your Music</a> and
          <a href="https://albumoftheyear.org">Album of the Year</a>, it
          differentiates itself through its comprehensive array of additional
          features, including blogging.

          How can I import my ratings/reviews from AOTY or RYM?
        </subheading>
        <paragraph>
          At one point, the answer to this was a resounding no, but following some research, importing both ratings and reviews from RYM will be possible without violating their terms of service. tasteful can't guarantee migration from AOTY, but we're still looking into it.

        <subheading>When does it open?</subheading>
        <paragraph>
          I have <strong>no idea.</strong> tasteful is a very real product,
          however, and is open source - you can view the code
          <a href="https://github.com/lachlantula/tasteful">here</a>
          and track my progress. The vast majority of the stuff that is not yet
          available on the public website is still in development locally, and
          will be committed to the repository once tasteful is closer to launch.
          Contributions are greatly appreciated, however, and you will be
          rewarded accordingly with a 'Contributor' badge.

        <subheading>How much does it cost?</subheading>
        <paragraph>
          tasteful will be largely free. Users may pay more for some additional
          features, but they are mostly customisation-based. We will be
          publishing more information regarding pricing in the near future, but
          there will be three tiers, ranging from a $1 to $3 subscription,
          renewed on a monthly basis. Lower-tier benefits may include an ad-free
          interface, while higher tiers may get additional promotion for their
          reviews.
