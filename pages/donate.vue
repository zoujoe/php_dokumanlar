            All of these are Australian organisations. We may donate to non-Australian organisations
            at some point in the future, but these are groups that we trust and usually have personal experience with,
            and as such can vouch for their quality.

              In November, tasteful focuses on <strong>mental health</strong>, and why wouldn't we?  It's an incredibly
              poignant issue that deeply influences many members of the music community - both consumers and creators alike.

          The Care Package
        </subheading>
        <paragraph>
          The Care Package is, essentially, just a donation to express your gratitude.
          I know that it seems self-indulgent to put this as an option, but we really want to give the opportunity for our users to not
          only keep the doors open here, but to also unlock even more doors for the awesome open-source projects that keep tasteful
          working around-the-clock.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          In addition to those causes, every month a quarter of all Care Package donations goes to a specific cause.
